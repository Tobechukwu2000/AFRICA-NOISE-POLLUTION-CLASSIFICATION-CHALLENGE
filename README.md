Due to the widespread noise pollution in our cities, data sponsors Sunbird AI recognised a need to gather data on noise exposure, in order to produce an action plan and empower citizens to be vigilant in tracking and monitoring noise.

The purpose of this challenge is to train a noise classification model to classify noise into different categories.
